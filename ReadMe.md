My MineSeeker app is a puzzle game based on the beloved and classic game Minesweeper.

Built in the React framework, it lets users choose between 3 levles of difficulty and gives them 3 extra lives (but if users want a challenge, they need only click on the lives counter section after the game starts).

Mark all of the mines with flags and you win. Enjoy!
